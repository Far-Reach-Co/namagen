# Namagen
A fantasy name generator for constructed languages

Currently console-based, but that is likely to change

[Download the binary](https://github.com/Far-Reach-Co/namagen/blob/navel/bin/namagen) (or build it yourself) and run it, then follow the instructions on the console. Very simple ^_^

Currently only one test language and one name type (with no options) are implemented
